# OGame REST API

## Disclaimer
The goal of this project is just to provide what's, in my opinion, a better API for the game I love. This is not a Gameforge supported project, just a simple contribution which I hope it can turn into something big one day. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions. 

## Changes

    - Moved from XML to JSON
    - Better support for /universes.xml
    - Better support for Region and Universe Name

## Getting Started
1. Check the [API Docs](https://cmartinezledo.github.io/ogame-rest-api/)
2. Play with it using the Mocking Service (Check the API Docs)
3. Any suggestions, feedback or questions, feel free to ask them in [OGame Origin](https://board.origin.ogame.gameforge.com/)
